        <p style="color: rgb(248, 248, 176);">Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern
            Cordillera of southern Peru on a 2,430-meter (7,970 ft) mountain ridge. Often referred to as the "Lost City
            of the Incas", it is the most familiar icon of the Inca Empire. It is located in the Machupicchu District
            within Urubamba Province above the Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometers (50 mi) northwest of Cusco. The
            Urubamba River flows past it, cutting through the Cordillera and creating a canyon with a tropical mountain
            climate. In reference to the site’s name, for most speakers of English or Spanish, the first 'c' in Picchu
            is silent. In English, the name is pronounced /ˌmɑːtʃuː ˈpiːtʃuː/ or /ˌmætʃuː ˈpiːktʃuː/, in Spanish as
            [ˈmatʃu ˈpitʃu] or [ˈmatʃu ˈpiɣtʃu], and in Quechua (Machu Pikchu) as [ˈmatʃʊ ˈpɪktʃʊ].

            The Inca civilization had no written language and no European visited the site until the 19th century, so
            far as is known, so there are no written records of the site while it was in use. The names of the
            buildings, their supposed uses, and their inhabitants are the product of modern archaeologists on the basis
            of physical evidence, including tombs at the site. Machu Picchu was built in the classical Inca style, with
            polished dry-stone walls. Its three primary structures are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the
            Room of the Three Windows. Most of the outlying buildings have been reconstructed in order to give visitors
            a better idea of how they originally appeared.</p>
