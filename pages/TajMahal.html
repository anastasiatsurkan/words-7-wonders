        <p style="color: rgb(248, 248, 176);">The Taj Mahal (/ˌtɑːdʒ məˈhɑːl, ˌtɑːʒ-/; lit. 'Crown of the Palace') is an
            ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was
            commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his
            favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of
            a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens
            bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall. The Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631, to be
            built in the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died on 17 June that year, while giving birth to their
            14th child, Gauhara Begum. Construction started in 1632, and the mausoleum was completed in 1648, while the
            surrounding buildings and garden were finished five years later. The imperial court documenting Shah Jahan's
            grief after the death of Mumtaz Mahal illustrates the love story held as the inspiration for the Taj Mahal.
