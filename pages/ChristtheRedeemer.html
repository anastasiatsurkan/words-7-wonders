        <p style="color: rgb(248, 248, 176);">Christ The Redeemer (Portuguese: Cristo Redentor, standard Brazilian
            Portuguese: [ˈkɾistu ʁedẽˈtoʁ]) is an Art Deco statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by
            French sculptor Paul Landowski and built by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with
            French engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida sculpted the face. Constructed between
            1922 and 1931, the statue is 30 metres (98 ft) high, excluding its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal. The arms
            stretch 28 metres (92 ft) wide. It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone. Christ The Redeemer differs
            considerably from its original design, as the initial plan was a large Christ with a globe in one hand and a
            cross in the other. Although the project organisers originally accepted the design, it later changed to the
            statue of today, with the arms spread out wide.

            The statue weighs 635 metric tons (625 long, 700 short tons), and is located at the peak of the 700-metre
            (2,300 ft) Corcovado mountain in the Tijuca National Park overlooking the city of Rio de Janeiro. A symbol
            of Christianity around the world, the statue has also become a cultural icon of both Rio de Janeiro and
            Brazil and was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.</p>
